# Sign up?

You cannot sign up yet. We will open up for attendees to sign up around the end of January 2018. An exact time and date will be announced a week or two before that happens.

# fee

Hopefully we will offer it completely free, but at worst you'll pay for food (at maybe 20-30 Euros).

# Sponsors

[Goto 10](https://www.goto10.se/) graciously sponsors the venue

[Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com) is our official stickers sponsor.

... discussions with more sponsors are ongoing.

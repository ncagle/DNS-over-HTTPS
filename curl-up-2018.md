# curl up

The annual curl conference and developers meetup. We talk and discuss everything and anything curl related.

# Sign up?

You cannot sign up yet. Keep your eyes and ears open!

# fee

Hopefully we will offer it completely free, but at worst you'll pay for food (at maybe 20-30 Euros).

# Sponsor?

Goto 10 graciously sponsors the venue, but we still have expenses that we'd love to get help with! Food and tshirts for example.

# Planning / volunteering

Yes we need your help both in planning and helping out at the actual event. Subscribe to [curl-meet](https://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-meet) and participate!

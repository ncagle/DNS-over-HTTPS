This is a proposed video meeting in the spring of 2024.

**Exact date is not yet set**. I'm thinking two hours a weekday, late afternoon European time to cater decently for North Americans as well as Europeans. Will

## Invited

People and organizations that package and ship curl and/or libcurl for their users. Linux distros, BSD distros, operating system people and the likes; intermediaries. And everyone else who is interested in the problems, solutions and challenges involved.

The event is open and free.

## Plans to join

- people packaging curl for Debian
- people packaging curl for Redhat/Fedora
- Daniel, lead developer of curl

(we don't need to list everybody, just show that we have some of the right people coming)

## Objective

Find out where individuals in the curl project can help improve curl in distributions and how distributions can help out the curl project upstream or even cross-distributions. To identify areas of improvement, ideas, or problems related to curl in distributions. Mutual benefits and cooperation.

## Topics

- What can the curl project do to help distributors more? Build system, third party libraries, documentation, tests, API/ABI etc.
- Can the curl project do anything to help unload distributors from some of their locally maintained patches?
- Can the curl project do anything to better streamline the work when we release security advisories for new releases?
- Can we improve the testing situation upstream/downstream?
- Can we help each other better with bug reports/issues?
- After PSL - what else have been missing in distros? Or perhaps: what features do distros actively disable and why?
- HTTP/3 - updates on status and discussions on how to (possibly) enable this in curl for distros going forward

## Invited

People and organizations that package and ship curl and/or libcurl for their users. Linux distros, BSD distros, operating system people and the likes; intermediaries. And everyone else who is interested in the problems, solutions and challenges involved.

The event is open and free.

## Plans to join

- people packaging curl for Debian
- people packaging curl for Mageia
- people packaging curl for RHEL/Fedora
- people packaging curl for Windows 10/11
- people packaging curl for MacPorts
- Daniel, lead developer of curl

If you *do* plan on joining and work on/with a distro, feel free to add yourself to the list or email me (Daniel) to let me know. It might ease the planning and make for a better discussion of we have a decent idea of the attendance.

We don't need to list everybody of course. It is entirely voluntary.

## Objective

Find out where individuals in the curl project can help improve curl in distributions and how distributions can help out the curl project upstream or even cross-distributions. To identify areas of improvement, ideas, or problems related to curl in distributions. Mutual benefits and cooperation.

## Topics

- What can the curl project do to help distributors more? Build system, third party libraries, documentation, tests, API/ABI etc.
- Can the curl project do anything to help unload distributors from some of their locally maintained patches?
- Can the curl project do anything to better streamline the work when we release security advisories for new releases?
- Can we improve the testing situation upstream/downstream?
- Can we help each other better with bug reports/issues?
- After PSL - what else have been missing in distros? Or perhaps: what features do distros actively disable and why?
- HTTP/3 - updates on status and discussions on how to (possibly) enable this in curl for distros going forward
- Long term support
- What do the distros want in the curl roadmap?
- Post Quantum curl and how to use it

What else?

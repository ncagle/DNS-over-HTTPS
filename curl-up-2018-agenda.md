|  | The curl test suite
|  | How should we improve the experience for Windows developers
|  | Is the time ripe to change `-X` (`CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST`) to only change the initial HTTP request and not the subsequent ones when following redirects? A common source for head aches to users.
|  | Add [JSON](JSON) support?
|  | Thoughts on [libcurl version 8](libcurl-8)
|  | Making the perfect pull-request
|  | The curl web site and infrastructure
|  | This happens on each PR/commit
|  | Internals. Walk-through of architecture and what libcurl does when doing a transfer
|  | What to do about URLs. We started RFC 3986 and we've gradually adapted for browser craziness. We're still not fully browser compliant. Should we be? Pros and cons. Discuss!


Bring your ideas, talks and topics you want to discuss to the curl-meet list.

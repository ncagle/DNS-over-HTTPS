# DOH

Do DNS resolves over HTTPS for privacy, performance and security. Also makes it easier to use a name server of your choice instead of the one configured for your system.

# Spec

[RFC 8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)

# DOH Tools

Facebook's [doh-proxy](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/doh-proxy/) and associated tools.

Daniel's [dns2doh](https://github.com/bagder/dns2doh) tool for generating DOH responses and questions.

Frank Denis' [doh-proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/rust-doh) (server-side proxy) and [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy) (client proxy).

Daniel Cid's [doh-php-client](https://github.com/dcid/doh-php-client) can be used to test and run DoH requests via PHP applications.

Travis Burtrum's [jDnsProxy](https://github.com/moparisthebest/jDnsProxy) DNS proxy and cache, implementing [DNS-over-TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858), [DNS-over-HTTPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-dns-over-https), and [Serve-Stale](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-serve-stale)

Star Brilliant's [dns-over-https](https://github.com/m13253/dns-over-https), with server-side and client-side implementation, written in Golang.

Alberto Bertogli's [dnss](https://github.com/albertito/dnss), a daemon written in Go which act as a proxy (the most common use case), and as a server (in case you want end to end control).

Dima Krasner's [nss-tls](https://github.com/dimkr/nss-tls), a daemon that makes gethostbyname(), getaddrinfo(), etc' happen through DoH, without any change to applications, thus transparently migrating all applications that don't use their own resolver (like some browsers) from DNS to DoH.

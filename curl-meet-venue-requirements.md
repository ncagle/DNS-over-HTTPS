A set of requirement/specs we would like to see in a venue to consider it fine for a future curl://up meeting.

## Size
It needs to be able to fit 40 persons reasonably. In 2017 we had 50+ people sign up and then we ended up with 23 or so finally showing up, but we want to let everyone in who wants to come!

## Rooms
We need more place than just a single room. Possibly one or two side-rooms as well where we can take discussions and unconference style talks.

## Food
We need to have it possible to get food catered and possibly use the extra rooms for eating/serving. By getting catered food and not going out to a restaurant we can use our time better and get more talks done!

Coffee/drinks for the breaks need to be handled.

## Evenings
We prefer venues where we can go back after dinner to do "hacking sessions" until late night for those interested in that.

Therefore it is also preferred to not be too far away from available dinner offerings.

## Weekend
The majority opinion back when asked in 2016 was that weekends are to prefer for curlup. It seems reasonable to expect 9:00 - 18:00 or similar for the regular Saturday/Sunday schedule.

It is very useful if the organizers can get into the place already on Friday to set things up and prepare.

## Equipment
Wifi that works for all attendees. A projector for presentations. Audio for presentations, which also can allow for remote presenters over video.

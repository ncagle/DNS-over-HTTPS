This is an attempt to improve the [curl.haxx.se](http://curl.haxx.se/) web site's layout to make it easier to navigate and allow users to easier and quicker find what they're looking for. Ideally, it should also work better on smaller screens/mobile phones.

(New logos, color schemes or font layouts will be handled separately if anyone would help out with or suggest that.)

1. Layout no longer using html <table> to show left side menu
2. Simplified front page - removed news, mailing list traffic table, weekly video
3. Made front page single-column
4. Put a "News" entry in the main menu (where the weekly videos are now found)
5. Removed "web site info" and "search" from the main menu - put the web site info menu item in the docs menu
6. Sorted the menu items alphabetically

Good/bad changes? What else should be done to improve the front page?

Here's a sample snapshot:

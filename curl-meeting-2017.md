## When

March 18-19, 2017

## What

The first ever meeting devoted entirely to curl and curl-related topics.

The plan is to schedule a number of talks throughout the two days but leave space and room for impromptu discussions and spontaneous presentations.

The exact presentations can very well be subject for discussion on the mailing list beforehand and everyone attending is encouraged to speak up about what exactly they'd like to hear and discuss.

## Discuss and plan the details

Join the [curl-meet mailing list](https://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-meet) to participate in the planning of everything. Also useful if you consider volunteering helping out with organization details etc.

## Agenda

See the separate [curl meet agenda](curl-meet-2017-agenda) page.

## Suggested topics

Some possible subjects could include...

 - libcurl internals, learn about the inside to increase your ability to debug and work on fixing libcurl
 - new protocols and upcoming technologies that people plan to implement support for in libcurl
 - discussion on current libcurl and we're going next: governance, core team, getting more devs, how to run the project
 - how to get more people involved in the project
 - what's coming beyond HTTP/2
 - will there ever be a libcurl v8 and what should it look like? (brain storm!)
 - curl quiz!

## How much does it cost?

We will charge (around) 40 Euro for this. That will cover lunch and coffee for two days.

## How do I sign up?

This has not been setup yet. Hold your horses!

## Who can attend?

Anyone interested in curl, libcurl and related technologies.

- curl hackers and developers
- libcurl binding hackers
- libcurl users
- curl fans
- internet application protocol fanatics
- hackers of similar tools or curl related technologies

We may have to reserve the right to turn people down, in the extreme unlikely event that we would get overbooked.

## Will the core contributors be there?

Daniel Stenberg will be there. Hopefully as many as possible of the other frequent contributors will show up.

## Tshirts?

Maybe.

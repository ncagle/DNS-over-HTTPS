## What

The first ever meeting devoted entirely to curl and curl-related topics.

The plan is to schedule a number of talks throughout the two days but leave space and room for impromptu discussions and spontaneous presentations.

The exact presentations can very well be subject for discussion on the mailing list beforehand and everyone attending is encouraged to speak up about what exactly they'd like to hear and discuss.

## Discuss and plan the details

Join the [curl-meet mailing list](https://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-meet) to participate in the planning of everything. Also useful if you consider volunteering helping out with organization details etc.

## Agenda

See the separate [curl meet agenda](curl-meet-2017-agenda) page. Please also suggest *your* talk there.

## Organizers

Dan Fandrich and Daniel Stenberg pull the strings.

If you want to help out, please subscribe to the list and volunteer.

## How much does it cost?

We will charge less than 40 Euro for this. That will cover lunch and coffee for two days.

## How do I sign up?

See [above](#sign-up).

## Who can attend?

Anyone interested in curl, libcurl and related technologies.

- curl hackers and developers
- libcurl binding hackers
- libcurl users
- curl fans
- internet application protocol fanatics
- hackers of similar tools or curl related technologies

We may have to reserve the right to turn people down, in the extreme unlikely event that we would get overbooked.

The Documentation page on the web site suffers from information overload. I want to fix this by splitting it up into a number of sub pages with docs for various areas. Each area would have to have at the very maximum 10 docs or we shall split it up further.

The existing 34 menu choices exist right now on the site (not all from the docs page atm):

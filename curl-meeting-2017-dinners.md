## Friday night, 19:30

    Barfüßer Nürnberg
    Hallplatz 2
    90402 Nürnberg
http://www.barfuesser-nuernberg.de/

This is a Bräuhaus, right in the middle of the town centre. Settle in to your hotel, then
come and relax with us before it all starts Saturday.

## Saturday night, 18:30

    Landbierparadies
    Sterzinger Str. 4
    90461 Nürnberg
http://landbierparadies.com

This is a short walk from the Z-Bau; a very "gemütliches" restaurant, typically
Bavarian (the locals would probably say Franconian). They'll even bring a keg
of local beer to your table so you can serve yourself.

## Sunday night, 18:00

    Hans im Glück
    Königstraße 74
    90402 Nürnberg
http://hansimglueck-burgergrill.de

This is a grill restaurant with great burgers, right across the street
from the main train station. Come grab a final bite before heading back with
memories of URL grokking still fresh in your head. (This one still needs to be
confirmed.)

(meeting link is pending)

## Invited

People and organizations that package and ship curl and/or libcurl for their users. Linux distros, BSD distros, operating system people and the likes; intermediaries. And everyone else who is interested in the problems, solutions and challenges involved.

The event is open and free.

## Previous meeting

Daniel wrote up this brief [summary](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/03/25/curl-distro-report/) from last years meeting.

## Plans to join

- Daniel, lead developer of curl (presumably also a few other curl devs)
- Christian "gromit" Heusel, Arch Linux Package Maintainer
- Leonidas Spyropoulos "artafinde", curl maintainer in Arch Linux
- Samuel Henrique "samueloph", curl maintainer in Debian
- Carlos Henrique Lima Melara "charles", curl maintainer in Debian

If you *do* plan on joining and work on/with a distro, feel free to add yourself to the list or email me (Daniel) to let me know. It might ease the planning and make for a better discussion if we have a decent idea of the attendance.

We don't need to list everybody of course. It is entirely voluntary.

## Objective

To make curl better in distros. To make distros do better curl. To improve curl.

Find out where individuals in the curl project can help improve curl in distributions and how distributions can help out the curl project upstream or even cross-distributions. To identify areas of improvement, ideas, or problems related to curl in distributions. Mutual benefits and cooperation.

The meeting is informal and we are all friends. 

## Topics

Feel free to add your proposed topics we should chat about.

- What can the curl project do to help distributors more? Build system, third party libraries, documentation, tests, API/ABI etc.
- Can the curl project do anything to help unload distributors from some of their locally maintained patches?
- Can the curl project do anything to better streamline the work when we release security advisories for new releases?
- Can we improve the testing situation upstream/downstream?
- Can we help each other better with bug reports/issues?
- After PSL - what else have been missing in distros? Or perhaps: what features do distros actively disable and why?
- HTTP/3 - updates on status and discussions on how to (possibly) enable this in curl for distros going forward
- Long term support
- What do the distros want in the curl roadmap?
- Post Quantum curl and how to use it
- the TLS situation
- trurl
- wcurl
- docs/DISTROS.md
- the curl-distros mailing list
- pending DEPRECATE items
- curl up 2025
- release candidates

## Not recorded

The idea is to have a casual meeting where everyone who wants to can feel they can speak up without risking anything. For this reason, there will be no video or audio recording of the meeting. We stick to written summaries/reports.
